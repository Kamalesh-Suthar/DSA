An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. An array is monotone increasing if all its elements from left to right are non-decreasing. An array is monotone decreasing if all its elements from left to right are non-increasing. Given an integer array return true if the given array is monotonic, or false otherwise.


Clarify questions:
Eg: Is empty array monotonic as well

Test cases:
	[1, 2, 3, 4] -> True (Monotonic Increasing)
	[3, 2, 1] -> True (Monotonic Decreasing)
	[1, 2, 2] -> True (Monotonic Increasing)
	[3, 3, 3] -> True (Monotonic)


Case 1: Non increasing: Previous element must be less or equal to the succeeding one
Case 2: Non decreasing: Previous element must be greater or equal to the preceeding one

	[3, ....., 7] -> Can be monotonic only if it is non decreasing
	[3, ....., 3] -> Can be monotonic only if it is neither non increasing nor non increasing : All has to be same elements basically
	[3, ....., -5] -> Can be monotonic only if it is non increasing


Time Complexity is clealy going to be -> O(n)
Space Complexity is constant space as no auxiliary space is being used -> O(1)
